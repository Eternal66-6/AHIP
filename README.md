# AHIP – Phase 0 Base Repomix

AI Healthcare Intelligence Platform – frontend and backend baseline.

This repository is the mandatory **Phase 0 Engineering Baseline** for AHIP.

It provides:

- Python FastAPI backend
- React + TypeScript frontend
- PostgreSQL-ready clean architecture
- Agent layer placeholders
- Context layer placeholder
- Decision layer placeholder
- Dashboard shell
- Docker Compose foundation
- Engineering baseline feeder document

### Phase 1: Platform Foundation & Data Model
- ✅ Initialized PostgreSQL schema with explicit constraints and seeded real mock healthcare data.
- ✅ Exposed REST APIs covering Patients, Claims, and Providers.
- ✅ Hooked dynamic React frontend tables directly to Live Database models.

### Phase 2: First Agent Development
- ✅ Converted static mock agents into advanced deterministic logic querying live database rows.
- ✅ Implemented `AgentExecutionLog` to create persistent Agent Memory.
- ✅ Validated full execution loop via `/api/v1/agents/run-case-review` and logged insights via `/api/v1/agents/logs`.

### Phase 3: Knowledge Layer & Context Engineering
- ✅ Designed strictly typed Pydantic Context Packs (`PatientJourneyContextPack`, `ClaimContextPack`, etc.) for precise Context Minimization.
- ✅ Refactored `HealthcareContextBuilder` to map raw database models into dedicated Context Packs for each agent.
- ✅ Added a visual Knowledge Graph Mapping UI to the React frontend to display dynamic Context Packs.

### Phase 4: Multi-Agent Collaboration
- ✅ Upgraded orchestrator to a collaborative pipeline with a `SharedCaseMemory` schema passed between agents.
- ✅ Enabled downstream agents to alter decisions based on upstream flags (e.g. `HIGH_RISK_PATIENT` escalates claims).
- ✅ Introduced a `ConsolidatorAgent` that synthesizes cross-domain observations into a single definitive `ConsolidatedCaseOutput`.

### Phase 5: Decision & Escalation Layer
- ✅ Built a `GET /priority-queue` API that functions as a Risk Scoring Model, sorting cases by SLA severity.
- ✅ Designed the React **Priority Queue Dashboard** to provide operations analysts with deep explainability for AI routing decisions.
- ✅ Implemented human-in-the-loop validation via a `POST /decision` API allowing users to Accept or Override the AI's recommendation.

### Phase 6: Enterprise Governance & Audit
- ✅ Added an `AuditLog` table and `decision_status` fields to provide an immutable trail for all AI and human actions.
- ✅ Implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), gating the Governance Dashboard to Compliance Officer roles.
- ✅ Captured manual override workflows with explicit justification requirements in the API.
- ✅ Built a live React **Enterprise Governance & Audit Trail** dashboard mapping every system trace to its responsible agent or human operator.

### Phase 7: Healthcare Operations Dashboard
- ✅ Refactored the frontend into a proper multi-page React application using `react-router-dom`.
- ✅ Built a persistent Sidebar Navigation using `lucide-react` icons.
- ✅ Created a unified **Case Details** view merging the Phase 3 Knowledge Graph Context and Phase 4 Agent Execution Timeline.
- ✅ Implemented a seamless workflow enabling users to click a Case ID in the Priority Queue and deep-dive straight into the Case Details page.

### Phase 8: Productization & SaaS Readiness
- ✅ Seeded a diverse Demo Dataset containing active/inactive patients, in/out-of-network providers, and clean/denied claims to highlight all agent edge cases.
- ✅ Polished the React UI with premium SaaS aesthetics (Glassmorphism, hover animations, dynamic gradients).
- ✅ Generated a comprehensive documentation suite (`docs/phase_8/`) containing a Demo Script, Product Walkthrough, SaaS Roadmap, and Deployment Checklist.
- ✅ Stabilized the repository and Docker orchestration for seamless MVP demonstrations.
